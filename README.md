### **NPT assessment for QD position**

Some notes:
- I have added the main features' CSV to the main folder as well for reference. I would usually intend to leave it in the git-ignored dataset folder for both safety and free-space reasons. It's light enough so...

Backlog:

- 08:00 - 08:40: data acquisition and cleaning. 
  - some issues: country nomenclature not the same for DA and power output endpoints.
  - messy data, not entirely familiar. 
- 09:40 - 09:55: feature selection models
  - only implemented mutual information metric
  - actually this is more of a research thing (long time since I have last needed to do something like this, both personally and in-site)
  - Don't usually use Scikit Learn myself.
